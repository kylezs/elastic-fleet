# How to deploy this app in a production ready state
NB: This has only been tested on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) and some of the steps/resources are LKE specific e.g. PVs and PVCs.

This application is a helm chart. To deploy you will first need to have [helm installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) on your machine.

1. Clone the repository and 

```
git clone ...
cd ...
```

2. [Setup a Kubernetes Cluster - This is the LKE guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/kubernetes/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/)


3. Setup the secrets. You will find a file called `secrets.example.yaml` this should be renamed to `values.secret.yaml` and the values within changed to your secret values. You should not share these values with anyone. Once deployed, this file can be removed and/or the values changed so as not to reflect the values of the secrets in production.

4. Ensure you have a domain name.
A domain name is required for setting up a [kolide launcher package](packaging-launcher.md) and for using a TLS protected load balancer.

## Setting up Ingress
We set up an Ingress (Load Balancer) in order to route traffic to each user facing application (Kibana and Kolide fleet). It also allows us to manage TLS in a central location, and means we don't need to use/remember a port when accessing our services (as we would if we just used NodePort), we can just use the domain.

[This is Linode's guide for setting up an ingress, that was followed here](https://www.linode.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-nginx-ingress-on-linode-kubernetes-engine/#install-the-nginx-ingress-controller)

Start from "Install the NGINX Ingress Controller"
